# K12Info

Service that shows schools from Kindergartens to High Schools

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Demo Available!

Keep in mind, this is a work in progress, but the current demo is available [here](https://henryko67.github.io/K12Info).

NOTE: There appears to be something wrong with GitHub Pages at the moment. If you wish to see the application's current state, I suggest you download the repo and run the application locally. I will try to fix the GitHub Pages deployment in the mean time.
